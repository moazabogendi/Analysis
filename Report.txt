This code compares two biological sequences, like DNA or proteins, to see how similar they are. It uses a scoring system,
kind of like giving points for matching elements and penalties for differences. The goal is to find the best alignment that gives the highest score.

The sequences, named x and y, are just strings of letters(A, T, G, C). 
The code compares them using a matrix that tells us how much points to give or take away for matching or mismatching elements.

To do this efficiently, the code uses a method called dynamic programming. It creates a matrix to store scores as it compares each part of the sequences.

At the start, it sets up the matrix based on some rules.

Then, it goes through each cell in the matrix, figuring out the best score by considering three possibilities: a match,
deleting something from sequence x, or deleting something from sequence y. The code picks the option that gives the highest score for that cell.

There's a function called Index that helps find the right place in the scoring matrix for each letter in the sequences.

Finally, the code gives us the best score, which shows how well the two sequences align with each other.

Time Analysis:

Iterating through the lengths of sequences x and y.
Time Complexity: O(m + n), where m is the length of sequence x, and n is the length of sequence y.

Alignment Score:

Nested loops iterating through a matrix of size (m+1) x (n+1).
Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m is the length of sequence x, and n is the length of sequence y.

Index Function:

Time Complexity: O(1), constant time.

Overall Time Complexity: O(m * n)
