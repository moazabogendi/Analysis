To determine whether an undirected graph is a tree or not, you can use the following properties:

1) Connectedness: A tree is a connected graph, meaning that there is a path between every pair of nodes.
2) No Cycles: A tree is an acyclic graph, meaning that there are no cycles.
3)Number of Edges: A tree with n nodes has exactly nâˆ’1 edges.

You can determine if a graph is a tree by checking these properties. The running time would depend on the specific algorithm or approach used. If you check all three properties,
 the time complexity would be related to traversing the graph and checking edges, resulting in at least O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
 The exact running time may vary depending on the specific implementation.
